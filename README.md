# Starbucks Recreation (Next.js)

This project is a recreation of the Starbucks landing page developed entirely with Next.js and TypeScript, its intention was to practice my personal knowledge about the technologies used.

## Technologies and Tools

## Learnings

This project made me better understand how Next.js works. The biggest challenge was adapting the interactions I was used to dealing with JavaScript to TypeScript, especially when creating the hook for mobile navigation.

## Deploy

To view the project deployment, access this [link](https://www.starbucks.com).

## Notes

The official Starbucks website contains an interactive section just below the cards that presents various information about the company, this was not implemented in my recreation because it is information for which I do not have authority.

**Important:** If you are viewing this project, own rights to the Starbucks brand, and in any way feel that this project violates the company's copyright, please contact me through any of the social media channels on my GitHub profile.
